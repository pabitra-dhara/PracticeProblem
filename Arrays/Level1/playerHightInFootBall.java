// 6.Create a program to find the mean height of players present in a football team.
// Hint => 
// The formula to calculate the mean is: mean = sum of all elements / number of elements
// Create a double array named heights of size 11 and get input values from the user.
// Find the sum of all the elements present in the array.
// Divide the sum by 11 to find the mean height and print the mean height of the football team
